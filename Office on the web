Office on the web is a free lightweight web version of Microsoft Office and primarily includes four web applications: Word, Excel, Powerpoint and OneNote. The offering also includes Outlook.com and OneDrive which are accessible through a unified app switcher. Users can install the on-premises version of this service, called Office Online Server, in private clouds in conjunction with SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Lync Server.[19]

Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on the web can all natively open, edit, and save Office Open XML files (docx, xlsx, pptx) as well as OpenDocument files (odt, ods, odp). They can also open the older Office file formats (doc, xls, ppt), but will be converted to the newer Open XML formats if the user wishes to edit them online. Other formats cannot be opened in the browser apps, such as CSV in Excel or HTML in Word, nor can Office files that are encrypted with a password be opened. Files with macros can be opened in the browser apps, but the macros cannot be accessed or executed.[20][21][22] Starting on July 2013, Word can render PDF documents or convert them to Microsoft Word documents, although the formatting of the document may deviate from the original.[23] Since November 2013, the apps have supported real-time co-authoring and autosaving files.[24][25]

Office on the web lacks a number of the advanced features present in the full desktop versions of Office, including lacking the programs Access and Publisher entirely. However, users are able to select the command "Open in Desktop App" that brings up the document in the desktop version of Office on their computer or device to utilize the advanced features there.[26][27]

Supported web browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, the latest versions of Firefox or Google Chrome, as well as Safari for OS X 10.8 or later.[28]

The Personal edition of Office on the web is available to the general public free of charge with a Microsoft account through the Office.com website, which superseded SkyDrive (now OneDrive) and Office Live Workspace. Enterprise-managed versions are available through Office 365.[29] In February 2013, the ability to view and edit files on SkyDrive without signing in was added.[30] The service can also be installed privately in enterprise environments as a SharePoint app, or through Office Web Apps Server.[19] Microsoft also offers other web apps in the Office suite, such as the Outlook Web App (formerly Outlook Web Access),[31] Lync Web App (formerly Office Communicator Web Access),[32] Project Web App (formerly Project Web Access).[33] Additionally, Microsoft offers a service under the name of Online Doc Viewer to view Office documents on a website via Office on the web.[34]

There are free extensions available to use Office on the web directly in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.[35][36]office.com/setup
